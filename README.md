<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview
I developed this portfolio page as a submission to a [DevChallenges](https://devchallenges.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/xobQBuf8zWWmiYMIAZe0) was to build an application to complete the given user stories and replicate the provided Figma design. I then customised it to fit my own needs.
